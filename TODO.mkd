* Add option to download by default (rather than play)
* Allow different quality settings for streaming/downloading
* Reduce (kill?) polling
    * e.g. could use `inotify` to check when the file was downloaded
* The "client" appears to be a daemon in itself... daemonise it?
* *stdout* is messy when there are concurrent downloads
